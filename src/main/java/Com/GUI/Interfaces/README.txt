The Idea of this interfaces is
Name contain GUI part and Actions
They all need just a holder nothing more
Each GUI class will have corresponding set of actions
the more significant it is more actions it can modify and use

For me it was need to remove many function from constructors of
GUI classes and put a simple box

Also you then can call supa modified version of an action
when it get updated throughout the pipeLine of GUI classes

All void update... methods must be used us setter or upgrade of the action
